    The Iron Yard Dallas
    Frontend Crash Course
    2/18/16 - Translating Design to Code

This repo will contain any code we write during the crash course. Our end goal is to learn enough about HTML / CSS to be able to slice up and reproduce [this timeline](http://jdabbs.com/tiy-design-dallas/index.html) (included as `reference.html`).

# Key Concepts

* HTML and structured content
* CSS and separation of design from content
* The box model and positioning

## HTML Tags

Here's a (probably non-comprehensive) list of the tags we'll use

* `doctype`, `html`, `head`, `body`
* `h1`, `h2`
* `p`
* `ul`, `li`, `ol`
* `div`, `span`

## CSS 

Similarly, here are our main CSS directives

* `margin`, `padding` (and `margin-top`, `margin-left` &c.)
* `position`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`
* `color`, `background`
* `display`

and selectors

* `tag`, `.class`
* `:nth-child`
* `::before`, `::after`

# Next steps

See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started) for CSS and HTML guides and references.

Explore! Developer tools are your friend. Pick a site you like and reverse engineer it. Cheat and steal liberally.
